VisionTransformer-CIFAR10
Overview
This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Vision Transformers are a cutting-edge deep learning architecture, originally developed for natural language processing tasks, but adapted here for computer vision. Instead of using traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this project uses self-attention mechanisms to capture the relationships between image patches, providing a novel and effective approach for image classification.

Objectives
Implement the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture.
Train and evaluate the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 images from 10 distinct classes.
Demonstrate the performance of transformers in computer vision tasks.
Provide visualization of test images alongside their predicted and true labels.

Introduction to Vision Transformers
Vision Transformers (ViTs) are an adaptation of the Transformer architecture, which was initially designed for tasks like machine translation and text processing. In ViTs, an image is split into small patches, each of which is treated like a token (similar to words in a sentence). These tokens are then processed by a transformer model, which uses self-attention to learn global relationships between different patches in the image. This approach allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies more effectively than traditional CNNs.

Key Features of Vision Transformer:
Patch Embedding: The input image is divided into small patches and embedded into a lower-dimensional space, allowing the model to process these patches as a sequence of tokens.
Self-Attention Mechanism: The model uses multi-head self-attention layers to focus on relevant patches when classifying an image.
Global Feature Learning: Unlike CNNs, which focus on local features (via convolutions), ViTs capture long-range dependencies, enabling better generalization for certain tasks.

Dataset: CIFAR-10
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used dataset for image classification. It consists of 60,000 color images across 10 classes, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more. Each image is 32x32 pixels in size, and the dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
